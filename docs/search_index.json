["index.html", "W201 Portfolio Welcome! About the author", " W201 Portfolio Christina Papadimitriou MIDS Fall 2017 Welcome! My portfolio consists of two ideas; Live Long and Love-with-AI. The first idea (Live Long) aims to apply machine learning techniques in order to “hack” life’s algolithm and enable people to live longer. The second idea (Love-with-AI) aims to apply deep learning techniques in online dating apps to help people find successful dating partners. Abstract: Live Long Advances in health and medicine have led the life expectancy of Americans to almost double from the previous century. Today the average lifespan in the US is 84 years for men and 86 years for women. Live Long uses machine learning algorithms to further increase human life expectancy by identifying key factors that lead to longevity. Live Long examines the relationship between non-genetic factors like BMI (Body Mass Index), body fat percentage, drug use, food type consumption (e.g. quantity of sugar, salt, fat, protein, processed food etc.), exercising, psychological factors (e.g. stress level), socializing and hormone levels, and lifespan. Supervised learning techniques including decision trees and neural networks are used to predict the output variable (i.e. lifespan) from the input variables that are mentioned above. Live Long has a single and undeniably valuable impact: it helps people live longer by allowing them to identify and control aspects of their lives that can increase their lifespan. Live Long can be a huge asset to biotech companies that invest in longevity research. Abstract: Love with AI Online dating has evolved into a 2-billion-dollar industry and one third of married couples in the US meet online. Love-with-AI is a product that can be leveraged by online dating apps. Using deep learning and neural networks, Love-with-AI creates a more refined online dating experience than what is currently provided by the most popular dating apps. Instead of matching people solely based on their shared interests and similar personalities, Love-with-AI uses an artificial neural network to “learn” the user’s attractiveness characteristics and builds layers to get closer and closer to making successful partner recommendations. Love-with-AI identifies patterns in the images and bios of profiles that are marked as “liked” or “not liked” by the user, and keeps refining the set of attractiveness characteristics for each user based on the labeled examples. Attraction is an abstract concept; others are attracted to opposites and others to similars. Either way, Love-with-AI is able to “learn” the attractiveness patterns of each user and suggest successful dating partners.

["live-long.html", "Live Long: Machine Learning for Longevity Can we increase lifespan? The algorithm to living longer Success!", " Live Long: Machine Learning for Longevity Keywords Longevity, Life Expectancy, Aging, Health, Machine Learning Can we increase lifespan? Advances in health and medicine have led the life expectancy of Americans to almost double from the previous century. Today the average lifespan in the US is 84 years for men and 86 years for women. Can lifespan continue to increase even further into the foreseeable future? Biotech companies have already started to invest in longevity research and intend to develop anti-aging drugs. Is it possible to “solve ageing” by “hacking the code of life”? Live Long uses machine learning algorithms to help increase human life expectancy by identifying the key factors that lead to longevity. The algorithm to living longer Longevity can be attributed to (1) genetic factors that cannot be controlled or changed (yet!) and (2) non-genetic factors that can be controlled by humans, such as lifestyle. This study examines whether non-genetic attributes can be used to predict longevity and, therefore, altered to increase lifespan. #Live-Long! Click here for Image Source Supervised learning techniques are used to predict the output variable (i.e. lifespan) from the input variables. The input variables consist of features like BMI (Body Mass Index), body fat percentage, drug use, food type consumption (e.g. quantity of sugar, salt, fat, protein, processed food etc.), exercising, psychological factors (e.g. stress level), socializing, hormone levels and several other factors. A training dataset that includes both the input and output variables is first used to train the model, which is then used to predict the output variable (lifespan) when given new instances of the input variables. Live Long uses decision tree and neural network models to accurately predict the most important features associated with longevity. These features may vary depending on the specific demographic types (e.g. race). The Live Long model examines such variations and clusters the factors that predict longevity based on demographics. Success! Live Long has a single and undeniably valuable impact: it helps people live longer by allowing them to identify and control aspects of their lives that can increase their lifespan. However, being able to live longer could result in unintended consequences, including overpopulation of countries, inadequacy of food, water and energy resources. In order for more people to be accommodated to live in this world, an extensive planning mechanism is required to ensure that there will be enough resources to provide quality of life for everyone. Under this assumption, living longer will be considered a breakthrough for humanity. "],
["Love-with-AI.html", "Love with AI: Deep Learning for Dating Dating Apps Need Improvement How the Machine learns Love You Can Find Love with AI", " Love with AI: Deep Learning for Dating Keywords Dating, Artificial Intelligence, Love, Romance, Deep Learning Dating Apps Need Improvement Online dating has evolved into a 2-billion-dollar industry and one third of married couples in the US meet online. However, popular dating apps like Tinder and OkCupid still use simple algorithms and questionnaires to suggest potential partners. Additionally, these dating apps match people based on their shared interests and similar personalities. But the truth is that people are not always attracted to people that are similar to them. Can we use data science to create a more refined version of the existing dating apps? Love-with-AI is a program that leverages Deep Learning to learn the user’s dating preferences and make partner recommendations that are closer to the user’s “type”. How the Machine learns Love Can a machine be trained via deep learning to learn what our preferences in dating partners are? Love-with-AI uses an artificial neural network which works like a biological neural network i.e. the brain. Using deep learning, it learns from the user and builds neural network layers to get closer and closer to successful partner recommendations. The program identifies patterns in both the images and the text of the bio in each profile that is being liked or disliked by the user. By doing that, Love-with-AI is able to classify the physical appearance and bio context of each potential dating partner to either “liked” or “not liked”. It then suggests partners to the user that are similar to those that he/she has liked in the past. Love-with-AI also learns from the messaging context among the users within the apps. Using Natural Language Processing, Love-with-AI analyzes the conversations among users to refine its dating recommendations. The program learns a set of attractiveness characteristics from the “liked” labeled profiles and the interesting conversations, and keeps refining this set every time the user uses the app. You Can Find Love with AI In order to relieve any user privacy concerns, Love-with-AI asks for the users’ consesus to leverage the program upon signing up. For example, if Tinder buys Love-with-AI, its users will be asked whether they want to allow the program to access their data in order to provide better dating partner recommendations. Love-with-AI gives any dating app a competitive advantage in the online dating industry. It uses cutting edge artificial intelligence technology to help people find dating partners by learning the users’ preferences from the labeled examples. The limitation that Love-with-AI faces is that it is challenging to teach a machine to perfectly understand something as old fashioned as love, but this technology comes close to accurately suggesting successful dating partners. Some are attracted to similars and some are attracted to opposites, either way, Love-with-AI is able to learn people’s attractiveness patterns and make suggestions accordingly. "]
