## A beginning. Dating Apps Need Improvement

Online dating has evolved into a 2-billion-dollar industry and one third of married couples in the US meet online. However, popular dating apps like Tinder and OkCupid still use simple algorithms and questionnaires to suggest potential partners. Additionally, these dating apps match people based on their shared interests and similar personalities. But the truth is that people are not always attracted to people that are similar to them. Can we use Deep learning and neural networks to create a more refined version of the existing dating apps? _Love-with-AI_ is a program that leverages Deep Learning to learn the user’s dating preferences and make recommendations that are closer to the user’s “type”. 

## A middle. How the Machine learns Love

Can a machine be trained to learn what our preferences in dating partners are? Love-with-AI uses an artificial neural network which works like a biological neural network i.e. the brain. Using deep learning, it learns from the user and builds neural network layers to get closer and closer to the “ultimate partner” recommendation. 

The program identifies patterns in both the images and the text of the bio in each profile that is being liked or disliked by the user. By doing that, _Love-with-AI_ is able to classify the physical appearance and bio context of each potential dating partner to either “liked” or “not liked”. It then suggests partners to the user that are similar to those that he/she has liked in the past. _Love-with-AI_ also learns from the messaging context among the users within the apps. Using Natural Language Processing, _Love-with-AI_ analyzes the conversations among users to refine its dating recommendations. The program learns a set of attractiveness characteristics from the “liked” labeled profiles and the interesting conversations, and keeps refining this set every time the user uses the app. 

## An end. AI Can Find You Love

_Love-with-AI_ gives any dating app a competitive advantage in the online dating industry. It uses cutting edge artificial intelligence technology to help people find their soulmates by learning the users’ preferences from the labeled examples. The limitation that _Love-with-AI_ faces is that it is challenging to teach a machine to perfectly understand something as old fashioned as love, but this technology comes close to accurately suggesting successful dating partners. Some are attracted to similar and some are attracted to opposites, either way, _Love-with-AI_ is able to learn people’s attractiveness patterns and make suggestions accordingly.
